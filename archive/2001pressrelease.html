SINGAPORE 2001</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B>Coordinated by the Raffles Museum
of Biodiversity Research, National University of Singapore on
Saturday 8 September 2001 from 8.30 am to 4.00 pm at Buloh-Kranji

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Raffles Museum of Biodiversity
Research (RMBR) at the National University of Singapore is
spearheading and coordinating the clean-up of the mangrove section of
the International Coastal Clean-Up Singapore (ICCS) 2001, as part of
the Museum's educational programmes. The event will take place on
Saturday 8 September 2001 from 8.30 am to 4.00 pm at the Buloh
&endash; Kranji mangroves. Low tide clean-up operations will be from
8.30 am to 11.00 am while high tide trash removal will take place
from 12 noon to 4.00 pm.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Now in its 10th year in Singapore,
the International Coastal Clean-up 2001 is part of an international
effort involving over a million volunteers in more than 100
countries, coordinated by the Centre for Marine Conservation in the
USA. The objectives of the International Coastal Clean-up are
to:</FONT></P>

<UL>
   <LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">To remove debris from the
   shorelines, waterways, and beaches of the world's lakes, rivers,
   and oceans;</FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">To collect valuable information
   on the amount and types of debris</FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">To educate people on the issue of
   marine debris, and</FONT></LI>
   
   <LI><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">To use the information collected
   from the Clean-up to effect positive change&emdash;on all levels,
   from the individual to the international&emdash;to reduce marine
   debris and enhance marine conservation.</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The International Coastal Cleanup is
the largest marine pollution cleanup effort currently in existence.
The event heightens public awareness about the vast problem of marine
debris, and more importantly unites citizens from many nations in an
attempt to do something about pollution in their communities. The
ultimate goal is to eliminate the need for such clean-ups by
deterring people and industries from polluting our waters in the
first place.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A mangrove section was initiated in
1997 in Singapore, and this is the 5th year of the mangrove clean-up.
The site chosen, Buloh&endash;Kranji mangroves is off the Western
Straits of Johore, east of Sungei Buloh Nature Park, and north-west
of the Kranji Reservoir Outflow.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This year, more than 250 students
from Catholic High, Commonwealth Secondary School's Girl Guides, St.
Andrew's Junior College, Tao Nan Marlin Sea Scouts, Singapore
American School, Middle School and SAVE, Temasek Junior College,
Victoria Junior College, Woodllands Ring Secondary School and Yusof
Ishak Scondary School are participating in the mangrove
clean-up.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A briefing session was conducted for
the first time this year at NUS for all participants to explain the
rationale of ICCS and the value of Singapore's biodiversity. In
addition, to better explain the depth and beauty of our mangrove
ecosystems, an introduction to the mangroves was conducted for
participants at the Sungei Buloh Nature Park. RMBR will also be
working together with the Sungei Buloh Nature Park, the Nature
Society (Singapore), the Singapore Amateur Radio Transmitting Society
and volunteers attached to these organizations for this
operation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In an afternoon high tide operation,
the Tao Nan Marlin Sea Scouts and volunteer sailors from the Raffles
Marina will transfer the accumulated marine debris to Kranji
Reservoir Park. The Western Environment Health District Office of the
Ministry of Environment and Altvater Jakob Pte. Ltd. will assist in
coordinating and hauling away the entire trash load at the end of the
day.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The data accumulated at the end of
this clean-up, like those from all over the world, is collated and
submitted to the country coordinator, the Nature Society (Singapore).
This is in turn submitted to the global coordinator, the Centre for
Marine Conservation where the analysed data is used to raise
legislative issues at the United Nations and at national level, to
promote public education programmes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><B>Members of the media who are
interested to cover the International Coastal Clean-Up Singapore
(ICCS) 2001 are requested to meet Mr John Larkin, Media Officer for
